Everyone had a nice and relaxing break.

The goals for the next milestone are:
  Admin permissions and user management.
    Business admins will have the ability to change certain aspects of their businesses’ account and the permissions of the accounts under it.
  Mentor profiles with contact info, availability and skills
    Mentor profiles will display their availability, contact info, and what topics are they able to mentor for. 
  Mentor - mentee matching algorithm
    Once a mentee is taken through the signup process, they will be recommended mentors, who’s skills, and availability match up with theirs. 

We created a freehand page (https://freehand.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/Bge7FqASS) where we will have a low fidelity mockup of the app.

New issues have been created in the github for the different components needed for the pages that we discussed (look at the freehand page).

Call to action:
  Daniel will be finishing some quality-of-life and working on the flow of the forms in the app.
  Maya will be working on the general style of the page and the post-login profile page.
  Jasper will work on…
  Shamus will work on…
