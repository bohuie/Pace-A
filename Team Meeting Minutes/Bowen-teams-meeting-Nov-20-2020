Meeting started 11:25 am.

Bowen wants an update on what weâ€™ve been working on and what plan we have for next week. As well as what we are planning for peer testing and what user tasks we have prepared.

First team to talk mentioned their login, signup page, and their sistem to have mentors and mentees interact with each other. For their peer testing they are going to explain that there are two user groups, and they will have the person who they are showing the program to, to be a mentor and the process to signup and authenticate via email. 

We talked on how we plan to have prepared the signup, login, password reset, and user authentication via email as our user tasks. Our peer testing should be fairly short.
