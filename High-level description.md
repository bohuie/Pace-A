High-level description:

Mentor.io is an online mentorship platform for organizations and nonprofits that connects mentors and mentees. The platform will include an embedded iframe form 
to fill out on the website for the mentors and mentees to sign up. There are 3 different user groups: mentor, mentee and admin. A mentor would have to meet a set 
of requirements which the admin will then need to accept and provide the mentor access to the platform. The mentee could fill out the form and an email verification
would then be needed to set up the profile. The admin is the final user group, after creating a private mentorship platform they will then have access to a sharable
link to provide the mentors and mentees and have them sign up to their organizations secure platform, which also permits admins the ability to add and remove users
at any time. After verifying the userâ€™s profiles, the user could now log in and see their matched mentors and mentees based on their skills and interests that they 
provided on the sign-up form. The mentors could then pick times for their availability on the calendar on their profile, or their matched mentees could request a 
meeting for a certain time slot. The platform will then allow the users to share the provided email addresses with each other and establish their conversation via
email.
